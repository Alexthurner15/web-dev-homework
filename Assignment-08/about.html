    <u><h2>About Page</h2></u>

    <p>I choose this project to learn how to cook more items & new recipes. Cooking was always an interest of mine, and I am wanting to learn how to cook different types of food (Italian, Indian, Chinese, etc). I grew up cooking and wanted to get better at it by making more advanced recipes. To learn more, look under the “cooking tab” by clicking on the link provided on the Home page (To Recipe Page). There are a large selection of other recipes you see under the “cooking tab”. Some options are Bacon, BBQ & Grilling, Bread, Breakfast, & Cake (etc).</p>

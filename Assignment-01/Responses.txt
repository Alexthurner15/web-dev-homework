5. The Web is created using nodes that connect with links that use references in a more useful way than a fixed system. The internet is distributed using a packet-switch network (blocks) in the fastest possible way in every direction possible. The web is different from the internet becuase it is a system connecting documents in a non-linear way (hypertext) versus a system that spans many independtly operated networks that is fully distibuted using building blocks (the internet). Another reason why the web differes from the internet is that the web connects or uses information (data) and the internet connects participants that share or send information. 

6. The internet works by using copper wires that are burried underground that connect servers together. For example, when you want to connect yahoo.com you first connect to a DSL (Digital Describer line) that connects to a ISP (Internet Service provider) which connects you to yahoo.com. If you are on the same server as your boss/co-worker and want to connect to two different websites you would use an IP Address which helps you connect to individual routers. This allows you to send or recieve back information to your computer rather than it being sent back elsewhere.

7. A directory is a file system that contains a reference to other files. The web describes the relationship between directories and files as a "Grandparent", "Parent", or "child" relationship. For example, images/ is a grandchild directory of web-dev-homework, which is image's/ grantparent directory. The path or direction for this image's/ example refers to the nesting of its folders or directories. Another example is Assignment-01 is a child of web-dev-homework, which is Assigment-01's parent directory. These examples describe the relationship between the individual files in the directory file system. 

8. The VCS is benefical because it is a kind of "database" that allows you to save snapshot of your project (at anytime you want) which the VCS (Version control system) shows you the difference between each screenshot in comparison to another. That's important because it helps you track changes, revert back to previous screenshots, and share and collaborate changes to screenshots. We use CVS to track changes to homework trial and errors, free hosting (cloud backups), and be professionally early.

    <br>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</br>
    <br>Thou art more lovely and more temperate.</br>
    <br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</br>
    <br>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.</br>
    <br>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</br>
    <br>And often is his gold complexion dimmed;</br>
    <br>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</br>
    <br>By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;</br>
    <br>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</br>
    <br>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,</br>
    <br>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.</br>
    <br>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</br>

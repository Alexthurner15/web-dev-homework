      <h1>Lyrics to "how to save a life"!</h1>
      <p>Step one, you say we need to talk
         <br>He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk</br>
         He smiles politely back at you
         <br>You stare politely right on through</br>
         Some sort of window to your right
         <br>As he goes left, and you stay right</br>
         Between the lines of fear and blame
         <br>You begin to wonder why you came</p>

      <p>Where did I go wrong?
         <br>I lost a friend</br>
         Somewhere along in the bitterness
         <br>And I would have stayed up with you all night</br>
         Had I known how to save a life</p>

      <p>Let him know that you know best
         <br>Cause after all, you do know best</br>
         Try to slip past his defense
         <br>Without granting innocence</br>
         Lay down a list of what is wrong
         <br>The things you've told him all along<br>
         And pray to God he hears you
         <br>And I pray to God he hears you</p>

      <p>Where did I go wrong?
         <br>I lost a friend<br>
         Somewhere along in the bitterness
         <br>And I would have stayed up with you all night</br>
         Had I known how to save a life</p>

      <p>As he begins to raise his voice
         <br>You lower yours and grant him one last choice</br>
         Drive until you lose the road
         <br>Or break with the ones you've followed</br>
         He will do one of two things
         <br>He will admit to everything</br>
         Or he'll say he's just not the same
         <br>And you'll begin to wonder why you came</p>

      <p>Where did I go wrong?
         <br>I lost a friend</br>
         Somewhere along in the bitterness
         <br>And I would have stayed up with you all night</br>
         Had I known how to save a life</p>

      <p>Where did I go wrong?
         <br>I lost a friend</br>
         Somewhere along in the bitterness
         <br>And I would have stayed up with you all night</br>
         Had I known how to save a life

      <p>How to save a life
         <br>How to save a life</p>
